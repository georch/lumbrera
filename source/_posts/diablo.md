I have always believed that creativity is influenced by three factors: the mind (intelligence - experience), the gut (technique - process - expertise), and the heart (passion - intuition)

I believe in the words of the Architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, "Less is more" and "God is in the details."  Also I am in love with the popular arts of the Baroque style.

A lover of music, but above all a metalhead, a fanatic of coffee and mezcal.
